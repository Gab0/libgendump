The famous library genesis has been taken out. There is a backup online on
a server at onion network, 22TB of books distributed on folders with 1k books
each... there is no search engine there and the filenames are md5 hashes.

Anyone with free time can enjoy the fine pleasure of dumping 22TB of books
to his drive and scraping thru them. <br>
Some books are really good, some are in russian :x

Books are saved under books directory;

```
python genesisdump.py    # runs the downloader, gets random books one at a time.
python bookReader.py # a tool to facilitate the scraping of books.. requires
evince.
```
